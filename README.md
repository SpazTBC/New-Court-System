YOU WILL NEED:
    - XAMPP
    - PHPMYSQL (COMES WITH XAMPP)
    - PHP



Import the SQL into a database called courtsystem

Put the Web Version (IF YOU WANT IT) inside C:/xampp/htdocs

If you want to use both the FiveM + The Web Version place the Web Version as previously instructed, then put courttablet in C:/xampp/htdocs (DO NOT UNPACK THIS). Both SQLs are the same and do not need imported again.

Insert sd-tablet into your server and configure to your liking.

Last Step:

ENJOY!
